# Framework.vue
Framework is a simple API-driven collection of components and directives for VueJS. It relies heavily on a JSON API serving data in a specific format, and by doing so, the framework will in return format, handle and show the correct GUI elements.

If you don't control the API, aka, make the API, then this framework is likely of no use to you. As it is intended to simplify the work of making a frontend website when it's the same person that is making the backend API. This framework depends on a specific output from the API.

This is a personal project, made to simplify my life. Feel free to use it, if you can, and want too.
